Madoka-Higuchi-Custom-Tab
=========================
A custom new tab page with Madoka Higuchi image in it, and a simple to do list using JavaScript localStorage. Don't worry, there is a search bar to browse the web via <a href="google.com">Google</a>'s search engine.

Note!!!
=========================
- There are still some bug for the localStorage that is used for the functionality of the to do list. But this won't occur frequently.
- I haven't made this page responsive, so currently this web is only addressed for PC/laptop browsers.

How To Install
=========================
First, download this repository as a zip (you can use the download link above), and then extract it.

Because most of the browser doesn't allow you to make your custom new tab page, you should download an extension for your browser (see the list below).
